# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a simple implementation of a Pomodoro timer, which is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5 minute short breaks.

## Overview

The Pomodoro timer helps improve productivity by encouraging focused work sessions followed by breaks. This project includes a main class that implements the timer logic, utility functions for time formatting, and unit tests for functionality.

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset the timer
- Track work and break intervals
- Mp3 audio that plays and pauses with the timer
